Node.js and MATLAB code solutions for MMI Music + AI

HW2 - Using MATLAB to iterate through a directory of audio files, extract a value from the STFT
magnitude, and write those values to a file.
    - Using Node.js to add to a starter code to measure the homophony of a music piece from a midi file.

HW5 - Using the FastPeakFind algorithm to find peaks (2D pick peaking) towards music identification similar to Shazam.
    - Chordal analysis using the HarmAn algorithm in Node.js

HW6 - Building Shazam in MATLAB -> Writing a function to calculate fingerprints in an audio file from a given directory of audio files.
